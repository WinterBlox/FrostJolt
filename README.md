# FrostJolt
Public Repository for FrostJolt, a Code Library for GameMaker v20229.1.51 and onwards that integrates Game Jolt's Game API Into a GameMaker Project.

## SUMMARY

FrostJolt for GameMaker LTS is a library of Functions, Scripts, Guides and Tools designed to help you set up Game Jolt's Game API with GameMaker.At the time of writing this, this library contains things for the following:

- Data Stores (both global and user-specific)
- Friends (fetching data about a user's friends or who they're friends with)
- Scoreboards
- Sessions (logging play sessions)
- Trophies 
- Users (authorizing and fetching info about them)

But more features are coming! This library is actively being updated!

FrostJolt has been tested only on Windows. If you would like to help me test FrostJolt on other platform such as macOS or Linux, shoot me a Direct Message on Discord or Game Jolt!
